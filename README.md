# theSugarStack

## Overview
**theSugarStack** is an interactive web application that explores global desserts while integrating key web development concepts. This project showcases the use of React for dynamic content rendering, state management, and modular component-based architecture, making it a great learning tool for frontend development.

## Features
- **Dynamic UI Components:** Uses reusable React components to structure the UI efficiently.
- **State Management with Hooks:** Implements the `useState` hook to manage user interactions dynamically.
- **Efficient Asset Handling:** Optimizes images and assets for performance.
- **Modular Architecture:** Separates concerns into individual components for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Styling with CSS Modules:** Ensures encapsulated and conflict-free styling.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **State Management:** useState
- **Styling:** CSS Modules
- **Assets:** Images representing different dessert concepts
